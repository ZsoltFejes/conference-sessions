        "description": "Building a high-performance, cost-effective cloud requires a deep understanding of the underlying storage infrastructure. The KVM virtualization stack offers a complex landscape of I/O technologies, from traditional iothread and aio modes to the newer, low-overhead io_uring. While these options promise different levels of performance and resource utilization, selecting the optimal configuration for a given workload can be a significant challenge for cloud builders and designers.\nThis presentation dives into a comprehensive benchmarking study designed to demystify these choices. Using industry-standard tools like FIO, pgbench, and rsync, we compare a range of KVM storage configurations across key metrics: latency, maximum IOPS, throughput, and CPU overhead. We will provide a data-driven comparison of different I/O modes—including io_uring and its predecessors—and explore how specific configurations impact performance for diverse workloads.\nJoin us to gain the practical knowledge needed to make informed design decisions for your cloud infrastructure. We will equip you with the insights to understand the trade-offs, identify performance bottlenecks, and build a KVM stack that delivers the best results for your specific needs.",
